## About project

Simple app, that shows weather forecast for 3 different cities.
On top of that can you can choose time period of forecast (eg. today, tomorrow or day after tomorrow)
and as a bonus it dynamicly changes background depending on choosed city or current part of the day(morning, noon, evening and night)

## What did i learned in the process?

- That was my first hands-on expirience with react
- Learned usual structure of react projects
- Got basic idea of props and state flow inside components
- Worked with OpenWeatherMap api, and learned how to dynamicly render data it provides
